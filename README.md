# StruggleSnake
Remember the snakes on black and white phones? Do you miss playing a few more?
I donâ€™t have to wait any longer, I can play Snake on the iPhone, the same classic, different operation feel,
With the advantage of the touch screen, you can control the direction of the snake by gently sliding your finger.
Unchanged eternal classic rules, eat fruit, grow your body, don't hit the wall, don't eat your own tail, the speed of the snake will increase with the length
